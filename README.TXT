Axiom is a very tiny MVC PHP Framework focused on simplicity and scalability,
designed to be fast to learn, fast to program with and fast to extends.
Contrary to many other PHP Frameworks, it is intended to create small and 
medium web application easily, without the complexity of Zend Framework or 
Symphony, but keeps the code clear and reusable in its MVC architecture.
